Here lies the preacher Zebediah Grey:
A pillar, incorruptible, severe;
Who suffered not the children at their play
Nor tidings but humility and fear.
"Tempt not," said he, "the wrath of righteous love-
The love that strips the unrepentant bare.
Lure not that retribution from above;
Look on God’s works, ye blithesome, and despair:
How fleeting be your joys, how little worth!"
The congregation trembled at his wow
And with him daily praised this hell on earth;
But friend if only you could see him now
Whose sneering adumbrated mankind’s sins-
If only you could see him— How he grins!
